            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>endered my reſpects to <hi>Mr. Corbet,</hi> the Chair-man thereof, he took a little book and read the title of it, <hi>The Oppreſſed mans Oppreſſions declared,</hi> &amp;c. and alſo turned to the laſt end of it, and read the concluſion, which was ſubſcribed <hi>Iohn Lilburn Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per idem,</hi> and told me he was commanded by the Committee, to ask me this queſtion, whether <hi>I</hi> would own that book for mine or no? unto which I anſwered. Sir, with the favour of this honourable Committee, I ſhall humbly deſire to ſpeake a few words, well ſaid <hi>Mr. Corbet,</hi> anſwer to the queſtion,</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid I, if you pleaſe to give me leave to ſpeak, well and good, if not, if you pleaſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me ſilence I ſhall obey you. Saith he the queſtion is but ſhort therefore anſwer to it, either I or no, Sir ſaid <hi>I,</hi> I am now paſt a ſchole boy, and have long ſince learned to ſay my A, B, C, after my maſter, but have now attained to a more ripe underſtanding, ſo that <hi>I</hi> am now able to ſpeak without being dictated unto what I ſhould ſay, and therefore if you pleaſe to give me leave to ſpeak my own words in my owne manner and forme, well and good, if not, I have no more to ſay unto you: Sir ſaith he, the queſtion is but ſhort, therefore you are commanded to give a poſſitive anſwer to it, unto which I replyed, Sir if you will not let me ſpeak my owne words, in my owne way, <hi>I</hi> will neither tell you, whether I will owne it or diſavow it, and with that he took his pen and writ part of what I ſaid, and read it to me. Sir ſaid I, what you have writ, is not full what I ſaid, and therefore if you pleaſe to give me pen, inke and paper, I ſhall write what I ſaid my ſelfe, and ſet my hand unto it, which he refuſed, but divers of the Parliament men, preſſed him to keep me to the queſtion. Vnto which I ſaid, Gentlemen, if you pleaſe to give me leave to ſpeak, well and good, if not lets come to an iſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and command me out of doores, for I will not anſwer you till I have free liberty to ſpeak, upon which one or two of the Committee ſaid, let him ſpeak, but ſaith Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> if after you have liberty for to ſpeake, will you returne a poſſitive anſwer to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? yea, Sir ſaid I, that <hi>I</hi> will, well then ſpeak ſaid he ſpeak. Sir ſaid I what I have to ſay, is in the firſt place, in reference to the houſe of Commons, for apprehending with my ſelfe, that my carriage and ſpeeches this day before the Committee, may be repreſented to the honourable Houſe of Commons, to my detriment and dammage, I therefore judge it convenient for me to fortifie my ſelf as wel as <hi>I</hi> can, and therfore <hi>I</hi> deſire humbly to declare; that <hi>I</hi> own the conſtitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable houſe of Commons, as the greateſt, beſt, and legalleſt intereſt, that the Commons of England have for the preſervation of their Rights and Liberties, and I doe not only owne their conſtitution but alſo I honour their authority and power, and the power and authority of all Committees, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally deriving their power therefrom, and ſhall readily and cheerfully, yeeld obedience to all their commands, provided they act according to the rules of juſtice, and to the good knowne lawes of the hand, but not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And in the ſecond place, I deſire to ſpeake a few words of my thoughts of this Committee, but I was exceedingly interrupted, not only by the Chairman, but alſo by other Members of the Houſe, and very much preſſed to give an anſwer to the queſtion, which made me ſay, <hi>Mr. Corbet,</hi> if you pleaſe to let me goe on in my own way, well and good, if not <hi>I</hi> have no more to ſay to you, for I came not hither of my owne head, to make a complaint unto you of my own, but I was ſent for by you, (as I conceive) in a criminall way, to anſwer ſomething before you in which regard, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114144:4"/>me to ſtand upon the beſt guard that either law, reaſon, or judgement can furniſh me with, and being that I apprehend, I am ſo much concerned in my preſent appearance before you, it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much concernes me, to be very conſiderate and wiſe, in managing my buſineſſe before you, therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you pleaſe, let me goe on to ſpeak out what <hi>I</hi> have to ſay, and I thinke in concluſion, I ſhall give you as poſſitive an anſwer to the queſtion as you deſire.</p>
            <p>So up ſtepped a welſh Gentleman, one Mr. <hi>Harbert,</hi> as I remember his name, &amp; deſired Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> to let me ſpeak on for ſaith he, you hear him promiſe to give you a poſſitive anſwer to your queſtion.</p>
            <p>Well then ſaith Mr <hi>Corbet,</hi> but will you as ſoone as you have ſpoken give a poſſitive anſwer to the queſtion? Yea, Sir ſaid <hi>I,</hi> (and clapt my hand upon my breaſt) upon my credit and reputation will <hi>I,</hi> then goe one ſaith he.</p>
            <p>Well then Sir ſaid <hi>I,</hi> two words concerning this Committee, and that at preſent <hi>I</hi> have to ſay is this, that <hi>I</hi> looke upon this Committee, as a branch deriving its power from the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and therefore honour it, and I looke upon you in the capacitie you fit here, as a Court of juſtice, and I conceive you look upon your ſelves in the very ſelfe ſame capacity, but in caſe you do not, <hi>I</hi> have no more to ſay unto you, neither if ye be not a Court of Juſtice, doe <hi>I</hi> conceive have you in law, any power at all to examine me. But none of them replying upon me, made me take it for granted, they took themſelves for a Court of juſtice, and therefore I went one and ſaid, if you ſo doe, that is own your ſelves for a Court of juſtice, then I deſire you to deale with me as it doth become a Court of Juſtice, and as by law you are bound, which is to let me have a free, open, and publique hearing. For Gentlemen, you have all of you taken the Covenant, in which you have lifted up your hands to the moſt high God, and ſworne to maintaine the lawes of the Land. And it is the law of the land, that all Courts of Juſtice ever have been, are, and ought to be held openly and publiquely, (not cloſe like a Cabinet Counſell) from whence no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diters are, or ought to be excluded,<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Colonell <hi>Fines</hi> his tryall, pag. 11. 12, 13. and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Tyranny diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, pag. 81. 82. 83.</note> 
               <hi>and therefore as you would not give cauſe to me to Judge you a company of forſworne men,</hi> I deſire you to command your doore to be opened that ſo all the people, that have a mind to heare and ſee you, and beare witneſſe, that you proceed with juſtice and righteouſneſſe, may without check or comptrole, have free acceſſe to behold you, they behaving themſelves like civill men. But here aroſe a mighty ſtir by ſome Parliament men, who declared, fiery indignation in their very countenances againſt me, but eſpecially, a Gentleman that ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
